Big cat (uh, oh)
Space Nazis, Robert Stack (uh, oh)
God damn it, gonna snap (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Leonard Nimoy, call me back (call me back)
I try to call you every day
I'm rehearsing what to say
When the truth comes out (of my very own mouth)
I've been working on a unified theory
If I make it through tonight everybody's gonna hear me out
'Cause I'm the right one
On my touch-tone, touch-tone telephone
I'm the only one
On your A.M., A.M. Radio
Oh, I'm crying now
Authentic tears
They flow out of me when I think about you
'Cause you're the only person in the world who'd understand
'Cause you're the only person in the world who'd understand the meaning of this
Oh, my God
I try and I try and I try (to make you listen to me)

CABINET MAN:

The day they found me, I hadn't yet been played
Inside my workshop behind the old arcade
Electric desires had unraveled all my wires
Now I'm in the box for safekeeping
The news reporters reported that I died
But all my organs were living on inside
Circuit board to brain with two lungs collecting change
One big human heart gently beeping
You can't win me, I can't be beat
I won't hurt you unless you cheat
You can't see me behind the screen
I'm half human and half machine
Thank God for business, they let me take the floor
I stood so proudly, like I was going to war
Players soon appeared and I quickly was revered
This must be what love would have felt like
Such dedication, they came from miles away
With eyes so piercing, they'd wait their turn to play
Perfect patient lines because I was in their minds
I could do whatever I felt like (whatever I felt like)
You can't win me, I can't be beat
I won't hurt you unless you cheat
You can't see me behind the screen
I'm half human and half machine
I'm happy for years and years
And, only eating the occasional maintenance man
Only driving a few kids to madness
Maybe they were predisposed to madness, who knows?
I only want to have fun
But now they're telling me my days here are done
'Cause there's a tiny little box that they make in Japan
And pretty soon it's gonna fit in your hand
It's getting lonely, it's getting hard to breathe
The arcade's empty, I think it's Christmas Eve
Someone's broken in, now they're painting on my skin
Breaking me and taking my quarters
Bashing in my face with a crowbar
Kicking me and pushing me over
Now they see my blood on their sneakers
You can't win me, I can't be beat
I won't hurt you unless you cheat
You can't see me behind the screen
I'm half human and half machine

NO EYED GIRL:

Oh, knowing what we know, knowing what we don't know
This is gonna change our world
Feeling how I feel, I'll accept the unreal
If you'd be my no-eyed girl
From nowhere mankind can go
There's too much light, blinding white
Your matter tells mine to scatter
It's alright, it's alright
From the moment that we met
I've been awake like I've never been awake in all my life
If I spoke your language, I could tell you how I feel
But your language isn't real
In every myth, there's a little bit of truth
But I cannot say a thing
I cannot say a thing
Without proof, oh, no
Knowing what we know, knowing what we do not know
This is gonna change our world
I might go insane if I learn your full name
If you'd be my no-eyed girl
From nowhere mankind can go
There's too much light, blinding white
Emotions, human implosions
It's alright, it's alright
Right before the kiss, I noticed something in the air
Molecules existed when there should have been none there
Chemical reactions with the surface of your skin
Some will say my actions let the no-eyed people in
And I'd do it all again
And I'd do it all again
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
And I'd do it all again
And I'd do it all again
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

WHEN HE DIED:

When he died
Turns out he left behind
A mansion full of other people's skulls
The odd thing is, they never found his own when he died
When he died
He somehow left behind
Strange symbols on the floor beneath his corpse
Investigators said the wood was scorched when he died
When he died
They found so many scorpions inside his lungs
When he died
The statues of his missing children cried
What was later found to be his blood
When he died (on a dark and stormy night)
They telephoned his wife (who reacted with delight)
But gradually her voice began to fade to nothing
And the laughing record played, the laughing record played
When he died
They found a message etched into his spine
That said when he died
An endless age of untold nightmares would be nigh
And the blood would make the seas run red
When he died (on a dark and stormy night)
A nearby shed caught fire (it simply caught alight)
And when they cleared the charred wood from the ground
Inside they found a painting of a clown (a creepy painting of a clown)
He'd painted it when he was just a child
But scrawled upon the back was exactly when he died
When he died
When he died
When he died
When he died

SWEET BOD:

Your body is so sweet now, baby
I'm saying trick or treat now
You know I've got to have you, yeah
You sexy sweet cadaver
All wrapped up like a mummy (ooh-ooh)
I'll cover you in honey
And wait a hundred years or so (oh-whoa, oh, oh)
You know, you know it isn't sexual (it isn't sexual)
Strictly confectional (strictly confectional)
Strictly medicinal (strictly medicinal)
If a little nontraditional
I'm digging up your coffin
And pouring out the contents
Your sexy sweet solution
Is prime for distribution
Sweet bod
Your body's starting rumors
Of Mason jars of sweetness
Whose satisfied consumers
Have often claimed to witness
Some sexy shrinking tumors, oh
A sweet return to fitness
They're just a hundred bucks or so (oh-whoa, oh, oh)
You know, you know it isn't sexual (it isn't sexual)
Strictly professional (strictly professional)
Entrepreneurial (entrepreneurial)
Oh, and what a sweet memorial
I'm digging up your coffin
And pouring out the contents
Good God, I'm glad to see you
Won't you be my panacea?
Sweet bod
Sweet bod
Oh, sweet bod
Sweet bod
Sweet bod

What in the name of God can I be?

ANCIENT ALEINS:

My mind's this cave
So dark, no moon, no stars
No sound
Just hearts and walls of art
Strange things happen
For no reason
That's all I know
My mind's this cave

SOFT FUZZY MAN:

Cold and windy
Dark and stormy
Let me float your way
Please don't ignore me
What you girls really need's a soft, fuzzy man
(An ambient man)
A trick of the light to love you tonight
You don't understand, there's nothing quite like a soft, fuzzy man
Can't you see me?
Why can't you see me?
I'm all around, all cold and dreamy
What you girls really need's a soft, fuzzy man
(A wisp of smoke man)
To waft over you and cloud up your view
So show me your hands and wave them right through a soft, fuzzy man
Although I have no arms to hold you in a human passion burns within me
I need to feel like I exist
So please baby, please baby, step into the mist
Don't be nervous
No, don't be nervous
I'm not like other guys who have a surface
What you girls really need's a soft, fuzzy man
(An atmospheric man)
A shimmering puff of indistinct love
What's better than the vague embrace of a soft, fuzzy man?
Who seeps through your thoughts
Who makes you see spots
Who blows through the air
Who plays with your hair
I know it sounds crazy, but once you go hazy, you'll understand
I'm your soft, fuzzy man

SPIRAL OF ANTS:

Over and over
The pheromones, the overwhelming harmony
Consuming the colony
The Circle rules your life
Chop, chop! Don't want to be late
Lift up and carry your weight
You've got no choice but to dance in a spiral of ants
True bugs might laugh in your face
Don't fret, you're leading the race
Don't let the bastards step on your hands in a spiral of ants

You've got to keep it flowing
You are one ant

Creating its own gravity

And the bugs who laughed got blown away
As we proclaimed:
The Circle rules your life

AMNESIA WAS HER NAME:

Amnesia was her name, she had beautiful eyes
And every word she said, it was a little surprise
Can't remember when I realized I was in love, la-la-love
Can't remember who it was I was thinking of
Oh my god... oh my god
The doctor said that I had tomato loss, all right
Dr. Amnesia was her name, she had beautiful eyes
We had spaghetti with long term memory sauce, all right
And every word she said, it was a little surprise
Can't remember how she smiled when she said my name...
What's my name?
Can't remember cause my heart jumped and hit my brain
I guess she didn't know how treat me right
Because I can't recall where I slept that night
I can't recall that special way
She told me, each and every day, her name
I can't recall the fact that I always said I loved her back
The same way, every time the same
The doctor said that I had beautiful eyes, all right
Amnesia was her name, she had memory loss... no wait
And every word I said, it was a little surprising, all right
And every word she said didn't make it across
Can't remember when we walked past the O.R. sign, surgery
Can't remember passing out with her hand in mine, my-my-mind
I remember waking up with my mind repaired, a-okay
I remember when I realized she wasn't there

MARKETLAND:

Market Town
What a doozy walking 'round
With all these putrid people everywhere
"You've gotta buy this!"
Screams a whiskey stinking vermin vendor
Holding up a rotten pear
But I hold on to my dollar
Looking all around me
In this place, I hide my face
But dirty people hound me
Market Street
I could use a bite to eat
But I don't want to buy a whole raw fish, no
No, not a blanket!
Yes, it's lovely but I'm hungry
And that's really not my favorite dish
So I hold on to my moolah
My mazuma, money
There's no trash that's worth my cash
It all just smells too funny
In Marketland
You can buy what's in demand
15 years ago, wow
In Marketland
All the world is in your hand
I'd go wash it off now
Market Lane
Either I'm going insane
Or there's an urchin hawking book reports
Oh, that's a new one
Some old guy with just one eye's
Selling his obviously soiled shorts
But I hold on to my dollar
Looking all around me
In this place, I hide my face
But dirty people hound me
Market Hell
There's no food too old to sell
There is no merchandise too urine-stained
"You've gotta buy this!"
Scream the whiskey stinking vermin vendors
Well, at least I'm entertained
Still I hold on to my moolah
My mazuma, money
There's no trash that's worth my cash
It all just smells too funny
In Marketland
You can buy what's in demand
Fifteen years ago, wow
In Marketland
All the world is in your hand
I'd go wash it off now

THE ONLY HOUSE THAT'S NOT ON FIRE (YET):

I feel knotted up today
But in a most exquisite way
Like neckties or like macramé
Bowlines and zeppelin bends
If you were a theremin
I wouldn't know where to begin
My hands would stay here on my chin
With a hum that never ends
This suit doesn't fit me
I made it myself, counterfeitly
With buttons of blue
Killing me with déjà vu
It's a gift for you
When I escape at last
When enough time has passed
But something keeps me as a pet
The only house that's not on fire yet
I made it when I was an architect
This is just the side effect
I feel strangely regular
But honestly, I prefer it to
The usual bizarre
Damn that oxymoron
If you were a piece of dust
I'd shine a light through the busted window
And I'd learn to trust
In the updraft that you're on
Click, click, auto-focus
The film's in the can like hocus-pocus
A picture of you
Killing me with déjà vu
Don't know what I'll do when I escape at last
When the end of time has passed
But something keeps me as a pet
The only house that's not on fire yet
I made it when I was an architect
This is just the side effect
The punch line is there is no punch line
The punch line is there is no punch line
The punch line is there is no punch line
The punch line is that there is no punch line
The punch line is there is no punch line
The punch line is that there is no punch line
The punch line is there is no punch line
The punch line is there is no punch line
Oh! I just thought of how to change all the hate
Into love with the old switcheroo
Dancing in my déjà vu
You'll be dancing, too
When I escape at last
When the future is the past
But something keeps me as a pet
The only house that's not on fire yet
The only house that's not on fire yet
The only house that's not on fire yet
The only house that's not on fire... (yet!)

THE AFTERNOON:

See the footprints in the cave?
I would follow them if I were brave
To find out why there's no second set of
Footprints in the cave
In the attic of this house
On the wall behind a propped up couch
Is a door that somehow leads into
The basement of this house
Oh, the less you hold out
More and more will fold out
Live for the afternoon
But oh, the more you grow up
Less and less will show up
Guess it's gotta blow up soon!
If you take another look
In the workings of your pop up book
There's a secret message left there for you
Take another look
If you choose a place to dig
And you make a hole that's deep and big enough
You will find exactly what you need
A place to dig
Yeah
Okay now
Okay, what?
Okay yeah
Oh oh oh oh, the less you hold out
More and more will fold out
Live for the afternoon
But oh, the more you grow up
Less and less will show up
Guess it's gotta blow up soon
Ooh, the less you hold out
More and more will fold out
Live for the afternoon
But oh, the more you grow up
Less and less will show up
Guess it's gotta blow up soon

BILL WATTERSON:

Where'd you go when you were done?
I'd like to know what you've become
Your biggest fan, awake at dawn
I cry, I stand on your front lawn
It's plain to see you're scared of me
But that's not how it's supposed to be
When you're the reason I'm in town
And every piece of mind you put down
Don't you know I think that you're the cat's meow?
Where's the tiger now? Where's the tiger now?
Bill Watterson, can't you hear me? (Bill Watterson, can't you hear me?)
Bill Watterson, please don't fear me (Bill Watterson, please don't fear me)
Don't treat me like I have rabies
I only wanna have your babies
Tracing lines with fingertips
I saw the signs within these strips
And through the fog, between the frames
Of dialogue, I saw my name
And now I know where I must go
To show you that I love you so
So I brought books for you to sign
And I brought shears to cut your phone line
Don't you know I think that you're the cat's meow?
Where's the tiger now? Where's the tiger now?
Bill Watterson, can't you hear me? (Bill Watterson, can't you hear me?)
Bill Watterson, please don't fear me (Bill Watterson, please don't fear me)
Don't stare at me from your window
I know you wanna let me in
Though, oh, you want me to show
How much I believe and prove how far I'll go to meet you
Through thunderstorms and snow
Well, I would do anything
And, oh, I happen to know
The reason you're hiding from publicity
It's not out of eccentricity
But rather for privacy when you meet me
And when we meet, I'll be complete
I'll shake your hand and kiss your feet
Confess my love and buy you flowers
And eat your heart and absorb your powers
Don't you know I think that you're the cat's meow?
Oh-oh-oh
Where's the tiger now? Where's the tiger now?
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Bill Watterson, can't you hear me? (Bill Watterson, can't you hear me?)
Bill Watterson, please don't fear me (Bill Watterson, please don't fear me)
Don't run from me like I'm Jason
I only wanna try your face on

SUNDIAL:

Don't mind me, I've just got some problems to work out
I'm only passing through or maybe just right out
Somehow something set my sundial backwards tilted and upside-down
Now the shadow hand is pointing time right out of town
I cease to see you when I start to shut my eyes
And I forget that I had said my last goodbyes
Quickly I reopen them and bid you all "Cheerio, my friend"
This goes on for hours and it never seems to end
I don't remember what it is that I just said to you
I've got Anubis on my back and something in my shoe
Don't walk backwards, don't be jealous
You're so bloody overzealous
I think I think I am unsure of what to say
Live long and prosper while the winter melts away
Sticks and stones and traffic cones may keep me safe while they break my bones
Needles live in haystacks like a swarm of tiny drones
Can't keep my extra senses charged for very long
Can't bear to tell you that you're wrong, so very wrong
Can't believe this brief reprieve is stretching outward and up my sleeve
Simply begs the question, how could I be so naïve?
I don't remember what it is that I just said to you
I've got Anubis on my back and something in my shoe
Don't walk backwards, don't be jealous
You're so bloody overzealous
Don't walk forwards, don't be silly, you're the heel they call Achilles's
Don't enjoy this private screening, this one doesn't have a meaning

SKY IS NOT BLUE:

I made you these construction paper dolls
Connected by the hands with tiny little faces
And now I'll hang them on the walls
So you can see the people filling up the spaces
I think I am the only one
To ever realize that I am
The only one to realize what's true
When all the world is stuck in a jam
The sky is not blue
I made you this defective little song
Connected by the chords, connected and melodic
And if you think I sing it wrong
Or if you think it sounds a little too robotic
Just let me know, I'll understand
And maybe when I play it next week
I'll think of you and make it pristine
As long as you repeat after me
The grass is not green
I might have stated what I thought before
I might have kept it in, my memory is failing
I might have stumbled through the door
You might have stared and asked what I had been inhaling
I might have blinked, I might have sighed
I might have been a has-might-have-been
But if you really heard what I said
You'd understand the mindset I'm in
Where roses aren't red
I'm setting up my tiny little town
A Lego set in which I'm planning to retire
It's really time I settled down
But not before I set everything on fire
Put on my boots, and stamp it out
The little yellow people don't care
They never did, and they never do
And yet they seem to speak with their stare
They tell me things I can't deny
They tell me I'm a sap, I'm a square
They tell me things I already knew
The greatest of the secrets they share
The sky is not blue

GEEKS IN LOVE:

Nobody's cool as we, nor quite as esoterically far out.
We're so far out it's creepy.
I don't think they'll ever get the groovy standards that we set for love,
but they're not smart like we be.
They have no roses.
Subconsciously they envy us a lot.
They look down their noses and see a couple of dorks with more love than they have got.
When they see us holding hands, they wish that they were geeks in love.
And when they hear our favorite bands, they wish that they were geeks in love.
We rattle off our in-jokes while they wish that they were geeks in love.
And while we make each other smile, they wish that they were geeks in...
La la la,
la la la,
la-lubbidy-da-diddy-love.
La la la,
la la la,
ka-boominy-wall-nutty-love.
La la la,
la la la,
ga-shibbidy-waffles-and-love.
La la la,
la la la la love.
As far as I can tell, while other lovers go through hell,
we'll know we're too cool for damnation.
We may not be cutting edge, but we won't take the mainstream pledge,
for we don't need your admiration.
They may not show it.
It doesn't fit their made-up little roles.
They don't even know it, but jealousy abounds within their souls.
When they see us on the street, they wish that they were geeks in love.
And when they hear us trick or treat, they wish that they were geeks in love.
As we lock arms and skip away, they wish that they were geeks in love.
And you can almost hear them say they wish that they were geeks in...
La la la,
la la la,
la-lubbidy-do-diddy-love.
La la la,
la la la,
fa-doobidy-ding-dong-love.
La la la,
la la la,

La la la,

PUMPKIN PIE:

There lived a merchant in the days of old
Who is remembered for the things he sold
No silly trinkets, silver, bronze, or gold
So I'm told, so I'm told
He made a most delicious pumpkin pie
Which he presented to the passersby
Before the sunset he'd be all but dry
Folks would buy the whole supply
He lived alone (he lived alone)
And every night he sat upon a throne of pumpkin pie
I do not know his name (he'd never say his name)
He never wanted all the fame that came with pumpkin pie
Before you knew it he was in full swing
His pumpkin pies became the next big thing
Soon he was called upon to feed the king
And they'd sing, feed the king
The pie of pumpkin filled the king with glee
He offered a castle for the recipe, but
The merchant wouldn't even give it up for three
No not he, no not he
He lived alone (he lived alone)
And every night he sat upon a throne of pumpkin pie
I do not know his name (he'd never say his name)
He never wanted all the fame that came with pumpkin pie
The king was angry and he came unwound
He called his men and soon the merchant found
Himself in a torture chamber underground
Tied and bound, he sighed and frowned
And so they tortured him for night and day
They made him scream so much his hair turned gray, but
As for the recipe, he would not say
They could not flay his pride away
He lived alone (he lived alone)
And every night he sat upon a throne of pumpkin pie
I do not know his name (he'd never say his name)
He never wanted all the pain that came with pumpkin pie

STUCK:

I'm just walking along
Stuck in a song, whistling thusly
Stereotypical life
Kids and a wife, three of them, plus me
Neil's inspiration is thin, thin as a pin
There isn't much to me
So I'm just walking along
Stuck in a song, happily gloomy
Break it off, break it off, take me out
Don't let the melody fake me out
Break it off, break it off, take me out
Don't let the melody fake me out
I don't even have a name
This brings me shame, I'm so diminished
I know all songs have an end
I could pretend this one is finished
I guess both ways I am screwed
Maybe if you'd do me a favour
If this track's on a CD, skip it for me
You'd be my saviour
Break it off, break it off, take me out
Don't let the melody fake me out
Oh, break it off, break it off, take me out
Don't let the melody fake me out
Break it off, break it off, take me out
Don't let the melody fake me out
(Don't)
Break it off, break it off, take me out
Don't let the melody fake me out
Oh, no
Oh, no
Oh, no
Oh, no
Oh, no

NEW WAY OUT:

One, two, a-one, two, three, four.
Burger King fries on a dashboard underneath the burning hot sun.
Burger King fries on a dashboard underneath the burning hot sun.
Serpentine alarm clock, ringing up a horrid little
kamikaze ding dinga-ding ding ding.
Serpentine alarm clock, ringing up a horrid little
kamikaze ding dinga-ding ding ding.
Jimi Hendrix Jr. with rock 'n' roll soccer mom.
Putting Michael Jackson on a rocket ship to Vietnam.
Burger King fries on a dashboard underneath the burning hot sun.
Burger King fries on a dashboard underneath the burning hot sun.
Nana korobi ya oki.
Ro-ma wa ichinichi ni shite narazu, baby.
I don't know my way around,
but if I follow every sound,
a new way out is soon surrounding me.
"And lo and behold, the very next morning,
they climbed out of bed and gazed out upon the morning world,
and to their complete and utter amazement,
it had not snowed at all.
The End.
Don't mean to bug, but I thought I'd tell you that your shoes are untied.
Don't mean to bug, but I thought I'd tell you that your shoes are untied.
In livin' in an illin' villakin I kinda caterwauled,
"Olly olly oxen free!"
In livin' in an illin' villakin I kinda caterwauled,
"Marco! Polo! Viva sanity!"
Oh, running 'round in circles like a Chupacabra Capybara.
Jamming on the harpsichord to Chris-a-tina Aguilera.
Don't mean to bug, but I thought I'd tell you that your shoes are untied.
Don't mean to bug, but I thought I'd tell you that your shoes are untied.
Nana korobi ya oki.
Ro-ma wa ichinichi ni shite narazu, baby.
I don't know my way around,
but if I follow every sound,
a new way out is soon surrounding me.

WHAT WILL HAPPEN WILL HAPPEN:

So what if I'm down? Stuck in reverse.
I look around... It could be worse.
What can I do?
Honestly, I've got nothing to offer at all.
Why should I grieve?
Why should I fall?
I'd rather breath, cover my ears, open my eyes and see what appears.
What will happen will happen whether I'm happy or sad.
What will happen will happen whether I'm happy or sad.
There are days to wake up for. There are dreams to be had.
What will happen will happen whether I'm happy or sad.
There's a reason I'm freezing at eighty degrees in a summery season:
I'm totally mad.
So, I'll let it go.
No need to sink now that I know that I can think,
therefore I am able to choose when I give a damn.
I refuse to be dumb.
This is my niche.
I won't become misery's bitch if I can hold apathy under total control.
What will happen will happen whether I'm happy or sad.
What will happen will happen whether I'm happy or sad.
There are days to wake up for. There are dreams to be had.
What will happen will happen whether I'm happy or sad,
and there's a reason I'm freezing at eighty degrees in a summery season:
I'm totally mad.
Not a hip hopped, not a heart stopped.
Everybody's gone stone cold crazy, like a cherry tree chopped.
Maybe Martin Scorsese's new movie just flopped, or
maybe some baby in a groovy helicopter.
We do, we do nothing but hold the window shut to keep the worry out.
We never wanna see the daylight fade.
We gotta masquerade to keep the worry out.
...But they have ways of making me think.
I can't blink, can't drink,
Can't put up a stink about the rattling battling and the countdown paddling
the motherland straddling the weaky freak link.
We do, we do nothing but hold the window shut to keep the worry out.
We never wanna see the daylight fade.
We gotta masquerade to keep the worry out.
Imagine a world without the Unabombers, and the Jeffrey Dahmers.
Wouldn't we be calmer?
Now, of course by "we" I'm only speaking for me,
but it's easy to assume that other people agree, you see.
We do, we do nothing but hold the window shut to keep the worry out.
We never wanna see the daylight fade.
We gotta masquerade to keep the worry out.
If I, at my own convenience, forget what they say,
I find it easy to focus on living each day.
If I could change it I would, to do what someone else should...
but I believe that the problem is misunderstood.
What will happen will happen whether I'm happy or sad.
What will happen will happen whether I'm happy or sad.
There are days to wake up for. There are dreams to be had.
What will happen will happen whether I'm happy or sad...

DEAD SEA MONKEYS:

I love my brine shrimp pals.
They are my friends.
I watch them float around inside their tank.
But when I came back home from school today my little
friends were dead and I was sad.
The other day they were alive, and now they're floating at the top.
I knew they wouldn't last forever,
and now they're just a bunch of dead sea monkeys.
Will my sea monkeys go to heaven?
Will my sea monkeys go to hell?
Will my sea monkeys go to heaven?
Will my sea monkeys go to hell?
The other day they were alive, and now they're floating at the top
I knew they wouldn't live forever,
and now they're just a bunch of dead sea monkeys.
Dead sea monkeys, dead sea monkeys, dead sea monkeys.
My brine shrimp pals have died a grisly death.
Why must the things I love just disappear?
Is it my fault?
Did I forget their food?
I hope they're in a better place right now.
Will my sea monkeys go to heaven? Yes!
Will my sea monkeys go to hell? No!
Will my sea monkeys go to heaven? Yes!
Will my sea monkeys go to hell? No!
I miss 'em, I miss 'em, me oh my!
I miss 'em, I miss 'em, me oh my!
I miss 'em, I miss 'em, me oh my!
I miss 'em, I miss 'em, me oh my!
The other day they were alive, and now they're floating at the top
I knew they wouldn't live forever,
and now they're just a bunch of dead sea monkeys.
Dead sea monkeys, dead sea monkeys, dead sea monkeys.
I want my monkeys back.
Give my monkeys back!
I want my monkeys back,
Jesus Christ!
I want my monkeys back.
Give my monkeys back!
I want my monkeys back,
Jesus Christ!
I want my monkeys back.
Give my monkeys back!
I want my monkeys back,
Jesus Christ!
I want my monkeys back.
Gimme my monkeys back!
I want my monkeys back,
Jesus flippin' Christ!
Dead sea monkeys, dead sea monkeys, dead sea monkeys...

FLAMINGO LEGS:

I love when opportunity knocks
It rocks the stripes right outta my socks
I love the world and everything else
The trampolines and jingling bells
I'd love to say there's not a thing I detest
I'd love to tie a piece of string to the best
Of what I know and keep it near, but I won't
I'd love to feel devoid of fear, but I don't
And I prefer it that way, I prefer it that way now
Living, living underneath a rock
Injuriously curious, the outline drawn in chalk
I know the words but don't understand
The karaoke effigy man
Flamingo legs of yellow and green
Attached to grandma's sewing machine
I'd love to say it's only fair, but it's not
I'd love to form a perfect square
I forgot my love of rolling down the hill on the lawn
I never noticed it until it was gone
And I prefer it that way, I prefer it that way now
Living, living underneath a rock
Living (under the catacomb)
In this (pile of styrofoam)
Outline drawn in chalk

KITTEN IS ANGRY:

My kitten, my kitty cat.
When she's content she purrs.
She thinks the house is hers.
But you won't like her when she's angry.
No, you won't like her when she's angry.
Angry, angry.
She's cuddly.
She's lovely when she's in a happy mood.
She loves her kitten food.
But she's got such an attitude...
Completely rotten attitude.
Rotten attitude.
Kitten is angry, kitten is offended.
Fur standing out and little claws extended.
Darting around and meowing quite a bit,
and throwing such a hissy fit.
I don't know what to make of it.
Don't touch her.
Don't look at her.
My kitten knows TAE KWON DO.
She can take you out, I know.
I've seen it before and it's not pretty.
She's really one ferocious kitty cat now.
(Oh no.)
She's deadly.
She'll hurt you.
She'll show you endless pain.
Her little whiskers are stained with the blood of those that she has slain.
Believe me, she will go insane.
She will go insane.
Kitten is angry, kitten is offended.
Fur standing out and little claws extended.
Darting around and meowing quite a bit,
and throwing such a hissy fit.
I don't know what to make of it.
Kitten is angry, full of discontentment.
Wildly attacking random pieces of lint.
Darting around in a psychotic blitz,
and throwing all these hissy fits,
but I still love my kitty cat to bits!
